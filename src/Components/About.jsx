To be honest, I'm absolutely in love with this career and life style. I'm always messing around with HTML, CSS and Javascript, although my recent passion is Build new things with React JS like this Portifolio. If you are interested about me and my latest projects, send me an E-mail or hit me on my social medias. </p>
